# Widget Dashboard

See Project: [https://cb-widget-dashboard.herokuapp.com/](https://cb-widget-dashboard.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

A former coworker and I were tasked to research Learning Management Systems. I took inspiration from our research and designs to build this dashboard featuring different widgets. The application frontend is built using Vue3, Sass, PrimeVue, PrimeFlex. 

Items I would still want to add:

- A drag and drop system for the widgets
- resizable widgets
- make all widgets functional (some are, but not all)
- configure an API around the data
